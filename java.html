                        &nbsp;&nbsp; Object Oriented Programming is an approach that provides the method of modularizing
                        program.<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; It Create the partition of memory area that stores the data & function. This
                        partitions
                        of memory are independent, So the objects can be used in different programs without any
                        modification.<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; Object Oriented Programming allows user to decompose a problem into a number of
                        entity
                        called <strong>" Object "</strong>. It builds data & function more close to the Object. The
                        Combination of data & methods made an objects . The data of an object can be access by the
                        methods
                        associated with that object or in other words we can sat that the methods can use only the data
                        provided in the class.<br />

                                Inheritance is concept by which objects of one class can acquire the properties of
                                objects
                                of
                                another class.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The base class features are inherited by the derived class.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Inheritance supports the concept of hierarchical classification. for ex. Robin is a part
                                of
                                flying bird which is part of class bird. The principal behind this type of
                                classification is
                                that each derived class shares some common characteristic is with class from which it is
                                derived.
                            </li>

                                Inheritance provides an important feature of oop which is
                                <strong>"Reusability"</strong>.
                                This
                                mean that we can
                                add additional features to an existing one.

                                The old class is known as base class and new class is known as derived class.

                                Polymorphism is Greek word, means "multiple forms". it is an important concept of object

                                Polymorphism plays an important role in allowing objects having different internal

                            <li> It was developed for the development of software for consumer electronic devices like
                                TV,Toaster,washing machine, oven.</li>
                            <li> Java is developed with syntactically similar to c and plus plus but removed number of

                        linked dynamically while executing the program at runtime.
