            storage. <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>eg.</em><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Add a button in your Application UI such as <em><i>ActivityMain.xml</i></em>

            Essentially you are using an intent object to invoke the camera using the <strong>
              "MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE"</strong> at the same time, you are turning the camera that you want to
            save the capture picture to external storage & name the saved picture "myphoto.jpg" , finally you call the
            <strong>StartActivityForResult().</strong> method to fire the intent object . This ensures the once the
            picture has been it's path will be displayed using the <strong>"Toast"</strong> class , this is done through
            <strong>onActivityResult()</strong> call back function to ensure that your application only be installed on
            devices with a camera . <br />
            <br /> You need to add the <strong><em>&lt;uses-feature&gt;</em></strong> element to your

            eg.<br />
          <p>
            To determine if location services are enabled on the device , you first obtain & instances of the location
            manager class using this instance , you can then check weather the GPS or network provider is enabled by

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accelerometer as there name suggest are use to measure acceleration , acceleration is
            define as rate of change
            of velocity so they measure how quickly the speed of the device is changing in a given direction using an
            Accelerometer you can detect movement and more use of the rate of the change of the speed of that moment
            generally you will be intrested in acceleration changes relative to a rapid movement such as use for user
            input in the formal case you will often need to the device to calculate the initial orientation and
            acceleration to take effects ito in future result .

            &nbsp;<b># Detecting Acceleration Changes :- </b><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acceleration can be measured along there directional Axis forward , backward , left ,
            right and up-down the sensor manager report sensor changes in all three direction (in the three
            axis).<br /><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vertical upward or downward where positive represent upward moment such as device being

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; longitudinal forward or backward acceleration were forward acceleration is positive ,
            these represent a device flat on its background facing up and in orientation being moved along the desk in
            the direction of the top of the device . <br /><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lateral Sideway acceleration where positive value represent moment forward the right of
            the device and negative value show moments forward the left in the same description aa describe in the
            longitudinal movement would be created by moving the device along surface to your right .

            event driven & to support regular updates which is perfect for maintaining game score or market price
            generating location based alerts & pre-screening incoming calls & SMS messages.<br /><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Notification are the standard means by which a mobile device traditionally alerts users to
            event that have happened in a background application using the notification manager you can trigger audible
            alerts cause vibration & flash the device's LED as well as control status bar notification icon.

            &nbsp;<strong># SQLite Database for data storage & retrieval: - </strong>
            <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Rapid & efficient data storage & retrieval are essential for a device whose storage
            capacity is relatively limited.<br /><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Android provides a lightweight relational database for each application via SQLite your
            application can take advantage of this manage relational database engine to store data security &
            efficiency.<br /><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp; By default each application database is it's available only to the application that created it
            but contain provider supply a mechanism for the manage sharing of these application database as well as
            providing an abstraction between your application & data sources.

            &nbsp;<strong># Shared Data & Interapplication Communication: - </strong>
            <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Android include several technique for making information from your application
            available fro use elsewhere using intents & content provider.<br />
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Intent provide a mechanism for message passing within and between application using
            intent you can broadcast a desire action system wide for other application to handle using the same
            mechanism you can register your own application to receive these messages or execute the requested actions.
            You cna use content provider to provide secure manage access to your application private database the data
            stores for native operations such as the contact manager are expose as content provider. So you can read or
            modify these data from within own application.<br /><br />
            &nbsp;<strong># P2P (eer-to-peer) service with Google Talk: - </strong>
            <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on SDK version it's expected that in later release you once again be able to
            send structured message from your application to any other android mobile using android peer-to-peer
            communication service the android P2P service use a special version of extensible messaging and presence
            protocol based an google talk instant messaging services it create a persistent a socket connection between
            your device and any other online handset that ensure communication with low latency & rapid response time,
            when made available you will be able to use the google talk service for conventional instant messaging or an
            interface to send dat between application on separate devices, this is a strong source for creating
            interactive application that involve multiple uses such as realtime multiplayer games or social
            application.<br />
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The P2P Service also offer presence notification which is use to see if a contact is
            online while the P2P service is very attractive in itself it also plays very well other android feature
            imagine as background service that transmit location between friends & a corresponding mapping application
            that display these location all alerts you when friends are nearly.

          &nbsp;&nbsp; Bigger screen & brighter higher resolution display have help make mobile multimedia devices to
          help you to make the most of the hardware available Android device provides Graphic Library for 2D Canvas
          drawing and 3D graphic with OpenGL. Android also offers comprehensive library fir handling still images,
          videos & audio files including the mpeg4, http , live stream , mp3, jpg, png formats.<br /><br />
          &nbsp;<strong> # Optimize memory & process management: -</strong><br /><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp; Like Java & .NET android uses it's own runtime & Virtual machine to manage application memory
          unlike with either of this other framework, the android runtime also manage the process lifetime, android
          ensures application responsiveness by stopping killing process as necessary to free resources for higher
          priority application.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp; In this context the highest priority is given to the application with which the user is
          interacting ensuring that your application are prepared for a swift but are still able to remain responsive &
          to update & restart in background if necessary is an important consideration in an environment that does not
          allows application to control their own life time.

          &nbsp;<strong> # Dalvik Virtual Machine : - </strong>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; One of the key element of Android is Dalvik Virtual Machine rather than using a traditional java
          virtual machine such as JavaME & Android uses its own custom Virtual Machine run efficiently on a single
          device.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp; The Dalvik Virtual Machine uses the devices underlined Linus Kernel to handle the Low Level
          functionality including security, treading and process & management, it's also possible to write C C++
          application that run closer to the underlined Linux OS, although you can do these in most cases there is no
          reason you should need to.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp; If the Speed & Efficiency of C & C++ is required for your application android provides a native
          development Kit NDK is designed to enable you to create C C++ library using the LibC & LibM library along with
          native access to OpenGL.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp; All Android Hardware & system service access is manage using dalvik as a middle tyre by using a
          Virtual Machine to host application execution developers have an abstraction layer that ensure they should
          never have to worry about a particular hardware implementation.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp; The Dalvik Virtual Machine executes Dalvik executable files a formate optimize to ensure minimum
          memory footprint you create .dex executable by transforming java language complied classes using the tool
          supplied with the SDK.
